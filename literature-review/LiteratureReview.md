### Issues in Crosswalking Content Metadata Standards ###
- discussing the fundamentals of crosswalk creation

"To reach the broadest community of information workers, metadata must be made available in accordance with a number of popular content metadata standards."

"there is a need for the metadata created and maintained in one standard to be accessible via related content metadata standards."

"**harmonization** is the process of ensuring consistency in the specification of related content metadata standards."

### Two Paths to Interoperable Metadata ###
Coral Jean Godby, Devon Smith, Eric Childress

"predictable problems... arise when syntactic translation is
not dissociated from semantic mapping.

This problem suggests that the problem of
interoperability must be addressed at a higher level
of abstraction. Just as writers of introductory
economics textbooks must make decisions about
how to identify and define key concepts that are
precise enough to be useful, but with detail
omitted that only experts can appreciate, so must
the designers of metadata standards."

The most constrained solution is a Web service template with multiple instantiations.

##### Goals #####
- The development of a self-contained metadata translation service,
- clean separation of the documentbdata model, the schema translations, and the machinery of the application,
- The automation of routine processes and
a well-defined place for human input,
- Support for current metadata creation
practice and for foreseeable innovation.
